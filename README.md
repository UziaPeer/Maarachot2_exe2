# SquareMat Project

This project contains a custom implementation of a square matrix class in C++ without using the STL, as well as a simple Queue class.

## Structure

- `include/`: Header files
- `src/`: Implementation files
- `main.cpp`: Demo usage of the implemented classes
- `Makefile`: Build system

## Build and Run

```bash
make
./Main
```

To test for memory leaks:

```bash
make valgrind
```
